My favorite form of real estate is online websites. There is a large opportunity to make millions of dollars on the web with a lot less capital requirements compared to other forms of investment.

One of the ways I’ve grown my wealth over the years is to invest in online real estate. Sure, I have my main companies like KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg, but I also own a ton of small sites such as Gym Junkies that most people don’t know about.

Here’s the process I use to make money from acquiring and selling sites:
Rule #1: Always buy distressed assets

The most important thing to remember when buying sites is that you always make money on the buy, never the sell. It’s rare that someone will pay a large multiple on revenue or profit, so don’t expect to get rich when selling a site.

But where you do make money is buying sites for less than they are worth. In many cases people are willing to sell sites for 1x yearly revenue or even 1x yearly profit. Sometimes people want out of a business for reasons such as death, divorce, or any other financial obligations that they have to meet.

Usually people who are willing to sell their sites for a low amount have these common qualities:

    They don’t update their site too often
    They don’t make too much money from it
    They don’t care about the business

If you can spot those 3 qualities, you can typically come up ahead on the buy side. If you are wondering how to find these sites, just reach out to website brokers and tell them your requirements.
